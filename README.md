# Movies Search

A simple Python project to fetch trending movies and using:
- TMDb API
- Web scraping

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with:
```env
API_KEY="34d00162b775b382e621499b550cc14d"  # Shared API key for testing
API_URL="https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
URL_SCRAPPING="https://www.themoviedb.org/"
```

Note: A TMDb API key is already provided for testing purposes. If you want to use your own key, you can get one by signing up at [TMDb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).

## Usage

### API Method
```bash
python -m src.main_api
```
Results will be saved to `output/movies_api.csv`

### Web Scraping Method
```bash
python -m src.main_scrapping
```
Results will be saved to `output/movies_scrapping.csv`

Both methods will save the movie titles and release dates to CSV files and display the results in the console.

## Architecture Overview

The project is organized using a **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** pattern, which separates business logic from infrastructure and makes the codebase more modular and testable.

### Layers

#### üß† Domain Layer (`src/domain/`)
- Contains the **core business logic** and **entities**.
- Independent from frameworks or external dependencies.
- Includes:
  - `models/` ‚Üí Domain entities such as `ScrappingSettings`.
  - `services/` ‚Üí Application use cases like `MovieAPIService` and `MovieScrappingService`.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`)
- Handles **external communication** and system integration.
- Includes:
  - `api_movie_handler.py` ‚Üí Interacts with the TMDb API.
  - `selenium_handler.py` ‚Üí Performs web scraping.
  - `csv_handler.py` ‚Üí Writes results to CSV files.
- Represents the ‚Äúadapters‚Äù in the hexagonal architecture.

#### üöÄ Application Entry Points
- `main_api.py` ‚Üí Executes the **API-based** movie fetching process.
- `main_scrapping.py` ‚Üí Executes the **web scraping** process.
- These scripts orchestrate the flow between domain services and infrastructure adapters.
